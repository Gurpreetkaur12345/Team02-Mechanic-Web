  next to Brisbane city. Mr. Suraj is the owner of this business since 2015 and customer in the area.
   He gets approximately 24 mainly serve local cars servicing each month. According to his research, 
   this number is too small for a high population density suburb like make his Kelvin Grove. Mr. Suraj
    want to business known to more people in the area. He recognized that he can only introduce his
     mechanic services to customers when they come to fill up the petrol at his station. He would like to have more channels of communication where he can advertise his business to customers. He thought he can improve his business by getting the business present on the Internet and Social Media. In 2018, he asked one of his friends to build a website to advertise the business 's services and products on the Internet. However, the website is very limited in both of user experience and user usability. What the website can do is to display a list of single products in chronological order without categories or filtering or searching functions. Old products seem to disappear from his website when he adds more and more products. Customers cannot easily browse for the products or services they desire as they cannot search or filter products. Therefore, he would like to have: new website which can effectively publish his products and services in a structured and organized way so customers can easily get the products they want. Ideally, the website should have an admin dashboard so Mr. Suraj and his team can add/edit/delete brands, tyres and services. In addition. the website allows customers book appointment for a special service and leave feedback/testimonial for the service they already buy. He hopes that the new website could attract at least 50% of current customers which will, in turn, increase his revenue.
