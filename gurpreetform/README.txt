Gurpreet Form basically has 2 different types of forms with different number of fields. It comes in two different colors with demonstration 
and can be implemented easily using a shortcode provided on the admin page. When we install Gurpreet Form plugin it creates a table automatically
into the database which stores the data which is entered by the user into the form after installing plugin and the same data can be retrieved when required.
